# Spongebob Trivia Game
## Welcome to my readme for my Spongebob Trivia Game! Created with Jquery, JavaScript, HTML, and BootStrap
This is a simple trivia game with only ten questions so far. Eventually, I may add more as it is easily scaleable.
# How To Play
To start playing, simply click the start button and the first question will be displayed. 
Each question has a timer of 15 seconds to answer the question.

If you do not answer in time it will counted as a wrong answer.

# End of Game
So far there are only ten questions, so once you answer them all it will display how many you got right and you can try the quiz again if you wish. Thanks for taking the time to check my quiz out!
